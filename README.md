# 2022_CUNY_DS_Bridge_Python

Hi Professor,
I was able to solve 1,2,3 and 5 by myself.
I struggled with 4 and 6.
THis is my first time coding python.
I really only have professional experience writing SQL queries.
This HW took me a while.
4 is basicaly the answer I found online which I couldn't even get to work.
So my answer to question 4 is not really mine, although i understand most of it.
Apologies I couldn't solve 4 or 6.
I didn't even know how to attempt 6.
